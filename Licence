All rights reserved.

## Overview

Paruse is a **viewer and storefront application** designed to operate as part of the Istockhomes platform.

This licence is intentionally written to allow:
- modification
- re-branding
- resale
- commercial use

while protecting:
- the Istockhomes network
- shared infrastructure
- automatic revenue-sharing systems
- long-term platform integrity

---

You MAY:

- Download and use this code
- Modify the UI, UX, branding, and presentation
- Re-skin the app for a specific brand, store, or entity
- Distribute the app freely or commercially
- Sell or transfer your modified version as part of a business, franchise, or entity
- Build additional features on the client side

You retain ownership of:

---

## What this licence does NOT grant

This licence does NOT grant you the right to:

- Copy, replicate, or re-implement the Istockhomes backend
- Create a competing database, network, or marketplace using this code
- Bypass Istockhomes payment, checkout, or revenue-distribution systems
- Remove or alter required platform attribution where applicable
- Present a derivative work as an independent replacement for Istockhomes infrastructure

This application is a **viewport**, not the platform itself.

---

## Platform connectivity and revenue

If your modified version of this app:

- Connects to Istockhomes infrastructure
- Loads content from the Istockhomes database
- Uses Istockhomes checkout or payment routing
- Participates in transactions surfaced by the platform

then:

- All transactions must be routed through Istockhomes systems
- Automatic revenue sharing applies by design
- Revenue splits are enforced server-side
- No client-side alteration may override or suppress these rules

Participation in revenue is automatic, not negotiable per build.

---

## Entity-based operation

This app is designed to operate as an **entity-based portal**.

Entities may be:
- branded
- leased
- operated
- renewed
- sold

Your derivative work may represent an entity, but the underlying network remains governed by Istockhomes.

Entity access may be suspended or revoked if:
- the licence is violated
- abuse or misrepresentation occurs
- attempts are made to bypass platform rules

---

## No warranty

This software is provided “as is”.

Istockhomes makes no guarantees regarding:
- fitness for a particular purpose
- uptime
- performance
- commercial success

Use of the software is at your own risk.

---

## Termination

This licence may be terminated if its terms are violated.

Termination affects platform access and connectivity, not ownership of your independent design assets.

---

## Intent

This licence exists to encourage:
- creativity
- real businesses
- fair participation
- long-term alignment

It is not intended to trap developers, but it **does protect the platform**.
