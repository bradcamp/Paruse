Paruse iOS viewer app by Istockhomes — browse and purchase only. No sign-in. No uploads.
# Paruse iOS — Viewer App

Paruse is a **viewer-only** iOS application.

Users can:
- browse items
- view details
- initiate purchases via external checkout

Users cannot:
- sign in
- upload content
- list items
- access admin tools

This repository exists to demonstrate:
- Swift / SwiftUI structure
- mobile-first UX
- calm, intentional design
- how viewer-only apps fit into the Istockhomes ecosystem

---

## Purchases

“Purchases are handled via secure PayPal checkout through Istockhomes infrastructure. The app never stores or processes payment credentials.”

No payment keys, credentials, or private infrastructure are included in this app.

---

## What is intentionally excluded

- authentication systems
- admin or upload flows
- payment routing logic
- API keys or secrets
- internal services

Those systems live in protected repositories.

---

## Context

Paruse is part of the broader Istockhomes platform.
